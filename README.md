It is possible to add "inline" CSS styles to our html elements using the `style` attribute like so:

```html
<p style="color: red;" >hello world</p>
```

While this is possible, it is a best practice to instead write styles in a separate CSS file. Provide at least one argument for why it _might_ be considered useful to write inline styles, and then provide a more compelling argument for writing styles in a separate CSS file.
